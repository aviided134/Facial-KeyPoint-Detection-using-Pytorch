# Facial-KeyPoint-Detection-using-Pytorch

In this project, I have created a deep learning based facial detection model using Convolution Neural Network(CNN). The main objective is to predict the location of 68 distinguishing Keypoints on each face. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on the face.

Facial keypoints (also called facial landmarks) are the small magenta dots shown on each of the faces in the image above. In each training and test image, there is a single face and 68 keypoints, with coordinates (x, y), for that face. These keypoints mark important areas of the face: the eyes, corners of the mouth, the nose, etc. These keypoints are relevant for a variety of tasks, such as face filters, emotion recognition, pose recognition, and so on.
