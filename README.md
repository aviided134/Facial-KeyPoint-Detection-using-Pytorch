# Facial-KeyPoint-Detection-using-Pytorch

In this project, I have created a deep learning based facial detection model using Convolution Neural Network(CNN). The main objective is to predict the location of 68 distinguishing Keypoints on each face. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on the face.
